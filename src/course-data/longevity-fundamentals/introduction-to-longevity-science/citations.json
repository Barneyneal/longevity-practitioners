Geroscience investigators are preparing to test this hypothesis in humans for the first time. In this review, we describe development of large-scale clinical trials designed to determine whether multiple age-related health conditions can be simultaneously alleviated with interventions targeting the underlying biology of aging. We describe the rationale and collaborative, consensus building approach used to design the first aging outcome trial called Targeting Aging with Metformin. Through this case study, we outline features that could be more broadly extended to other geroscience-guided clinical trials, including a process for selecting biochemical and molecular markers of biologic age and we provide a perspective on the potential impact of clinical t",

This unprecedented paradigm shift requires optimizing the design of future clinical studies related to aging in humans. Researchers will face a number of challenges, including ideal populations to study, which lifestyle and Gerotherapeutic interventions to test initially, selecting key primary and secondary outcomes of such clinical trials, and which age-related biomarkers are most valuable for both selecting interventions and predicting or monitoring clinical responses (\u201cGerodiagnostics\u201d).

Many efforts have been put forth to understand and prevent the effects of aging. Thus, the major cellular and molecular hallmarks of aging have been identified, and their relationships to age-related diseases and malfunctions have been explored. Here, we use data from the CAS Content Collection to analyze the publication landscape of recent aging-related research. We review the advances in knowledge and delineate trends in research advancements on aging factors and attributes across time and geography. We also review the current concepts related to the major aging hallmarks on the molecular, cellular, and organismic level, age-associated diseases, with attention to brain aging and brain health, as well as the major biochemical proces",

Aging is also considered the number one cause of poor quality of life, disease, disability, and death, so the importance of understanding the aging process and how to control certain aspects of it cannot be underestimated when age related suffering is factored in. The causes of aging are now becoming well understood, and in recent years many therapies have already become available to the public to attenuate specific corridors of aging. The heterogeneity of the aging process and the biological drivers involved is examined here in parallel with various compounds and therapies to combat biological decline. The benefits for governments in keeping their populations healthy and vibrant are vast, and at the same time offer a great incentive to invest into newly em",

Effective, evidence-based interventions for HF prevention and management are needed to improve patient longevity, symptom control, and quality of life. Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet interventions can have a positive impact for HF patients. However, the absence of a consensus for comprehensive dietary guidelines and for pragmatic evidence limits the ability of health care providers to implement clinical recommendations. The refinement of medical nutrition therapy through precision nutrition approaches has the potential to reduce the burden of HF, improve clinical care, and meet the needs of diverse patients. The aim of this review is to summarize current evidence related to HF dietary recommendations including DASH diet nutritional interventions and to develop initial recommendations for DASH diet implementation in outpatient HF management. Articles involving human studies were obtained using the followin",

To better understand the role of lifestyle and environment, Buettner set out to \u201creverse engineer longevity.\u201d In association with National Geographic and with funding from the National Institute on Aging, Buettner and a team of demographers studied census data and identified five pockets where people are living verifiably longer lives by a number of measurements (Ikaria, Greece; Loma Linda, California; Nicoya, Costa Rica; Okinawa, Japan; Sardinia, Italy; see Box 2-1). A team of experts then used established methodologies to try to determine why people had such remarkable longevity in these areas, which were dubbed \u201cblue zones.\u201d The intent, Buettner explained, was to identify lessons o",

                  "citation_abstract": "What began as a National Geographic expedition, lead by Dan Buettner, to uncover the secrets of longevity, evolved into the discovery of the 5 places around the world where people consistently live over 100 years old, dubbed the Blue Zones. Dan and his team of demographers, scientist and anthropologists were able to distill the evidence-based common denominators of these Blue Zones into 9 commonalities that they call the Power 9. They have since taken these principles into communities across the United States working with policy makers, local businesses, schools and individuals to shape the environments of the Blue Zones Project Communities. What has been found is that putting the responsibility of curating a healthy environment on an individual does not work, but through policy and environmental changes the Blue Zones Project Communities have been able to increase life expectancy, reduce obesity and make the healthy choice the easy choice for millions of Americans.",

Remarkable progress has led this field toward animal trials and the next challenge lies with translation to humans. There is an emerging number of small human trials that can take advantage of new models integrating behavioral and social factors. Understanding dynamic aging mechanisms, given the powerful social determinants of aging (Crimmins, 2020) and human variability and environmental contexts (Moffitt, 2020), will be critical<strong>. Behavioral and social factors are intrinsic to aging. Toxic stressors</strong> broadly defined can lead to <strong>stress-acceleration of aging</strong>, either di",
